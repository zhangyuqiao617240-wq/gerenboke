Long nights and weekends were spent keeping this project strong and dependable, with no ask for compensation or funding, until now. If your company uses `better-sqlite3`, ask your manager to consider supporting the project:\n\n- [Become a GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/JoshuaWise)\n- [Become a backer on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/joshuawise)\n- [Make a one-time donation on PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/joshuathomaswise)\n\n## How other libraries compare\n\n|   |select 1 row &nbsp;`get()`&nbsp;|select 100 rows &nbsp;&nbsp;`all()`&nbsp;&nbsp;|select 100 rows `iterate()` 1-by-1|insert 1 row `run()`|insert 100 rows in a transaction|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|better-sqlite3|1x|1x|1x|1x|1x|\n|[sqlite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite) and [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3)|11.7x slower|2.9x slower|24.4x slower|2.8x slower|15.6x slower|\n\n> You can verify these results by [running the benchmark yourself](./docs/benchmark.md).\n\n## Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install better-sqlite3\n```\n\n> Requires Node.js v14.21.1 or later. Prebuilt binaries are available for [LTS versions](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/). If you have trouble installing, check the [troubleshooting guide](./docs/troubleshooting.md).\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst db = require('better-sqlite3')('foobar.db', options);\n\nconst row = db.prepare('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?').get(userId);\nconsole.log(row.firstName, row.lastName, row.email);\n```\n\nThough not required, [it is generally important to set the WAL pragma for performance reasons](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/performance.md).\n\n```js\ndb.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');\n```\n\n##### In ES6 module notation:\n\n```js\nimport Database from 'better-sqlite3';\nconst db = new Database('foobar.db', options);\ndb.pragma('journal_mode = WAL');\n```\n\n## Why should I use this instead of [node-sqlite3](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3)?\n\n- `node-sqlite3` uses asynchronous APIs for tasks that are either CPU-bound or serialized. That's not only bad design, but it wastes tons of resources. It also causes [mutex thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_contention) which has devastating effects on performance.\n- `node-sqlite3` exposes low-level (C language) memory management functions. `better-sqlite3` does it the JavaScript way, allowing the garbage collector to worry about memory management.\n- `better-sqlite3` is simpler to use, and it provides nice utilities for some operations that are very difficult or impossible in `node-sqlite3`.\n- `better-sqlite3` is much faster than `node-sqlite3` in most cases, and just as fast in all other cases.\n\n#### When is this library not appropriate?\n\nIn most cases, if you're attempting something that cannot be reasonably accomplished with `better-sqlite3`, it probably cannot be reasonably accomplished with SQLite in general. For example, if you're executing queries that take one second to complete, and you expect to have many concurrent users executing those queries, no amount of asynchronicity will save you from SQLite's serialized nature. Fortunately, SQLite is very *very* fast. With proper indexing, we've been able to achieve upward of 2000 queries per second with 5-way-joins in a 60 GB database, where each query was handling 5–50 kilobytes of real data.\n\nIf you have a performance problem, the most likely causes are inefficient queries, improper indexing, or a lack of [WAL mode](./docs/performance.md)—not `better-sqlite3` itself. However, there are some cases where `better-sqlite3` could be inappropriate:\n\n- If you expect a high volume of concurrent reads each returning many megabytes of data (i.e., videos)\n- If you expect a high volume of concurrent writes (i.e., a social media site)\n- If your database's size is near the terabyte range\n\nFor these situations, you should probably use a full-fledged RDBMS such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).\n\n## Upgrading\n\nUpgrading your `better-sqlite3` dependency can potentially introduce breaking changes, either in the `better-sqlite3` API (if you upgrade to a new [major version](https://semver.org/)), or between your existing database(s) and the underlying version of SQLite.
