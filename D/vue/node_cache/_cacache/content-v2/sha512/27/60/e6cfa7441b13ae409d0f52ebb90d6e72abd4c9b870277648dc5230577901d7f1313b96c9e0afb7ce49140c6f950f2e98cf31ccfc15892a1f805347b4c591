the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. When building for production Lightning CSS will be enabled otherwise it is disabled.\n\nIf you want to always enable or disable Lightning CSS the `optimize` option may be used:\n\n```js\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    tailwindcss({\n      // Disable Lightning CSS optimization\n      optimize: false,\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n```\n\nIt's also possible to keep Lightning CSS enabled but disable minification:\n\n```js\nimport tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vite'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [\n    tailwindcss({\n      // Enable Lightning CSS but disable minification\n      optimize: { minify: false },\n    }),\n  ],\n})\n```\n","_source_registry_name":"default","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues"},"homepage":"https://tailwindcss.com","license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.git","directory":"packages/@tailwindcss-vite"}}
