Here is the first one to get you started:\n\n```js\nconst knex = require('knex')({\n  client: 'sqlite3',\n  connection: {\n    filename: './data.db',\n  },\n});\n\ntry {\n  // Create a table\n  await knex.schema\n    .createTable('users', (table) => {\n      table.increments('id');\n      table.string('user_name');\n    })\n    // ...and another\n    .createTable('accounts', (table) => {\n      table.increments('id');\n      table.string('account_name');\n      table.integer('user_id').unsigned().references('users.id');\n    });\n\n  // Then query the table...\n  const insertedRows = await knex('users').insert({ user_name: 'Tim' });\n\n  // ...and using the insert id, insert into the other table.\n  await knex('accounts').insert({\n    account_name: 'knex',\n    user_id: insertedRows[0],\n  });\n\n  // Query both of the rows.\n  const selectedRows = await knex('users')\n    .join('accounts', 'users.id', 'accounts.user_id')\n    .select('users.user_name as user', 'accounts.account_name as account');\n\n  // map over the results\n  const enrichedRows = selectedRows.map((row) => ({ ...row, active: true }));\n\n  // Finally, add a catch statement\n} catch (e) {\n  console.error(e);\n}\n```\n\n## TypeScript example\n\n```ts\nimport { Knex, knex } from 'knex';\n\ninterface User {\n  id: number;\n  age: number;\n  name: string;\n  active: boolean;\n  departmentId: number;\n}\n\nconst config: Knex.Config = {\n  client: 'sqlite3',\n  connection: {\n    filename: './data.db',\n  },\n};\n\nconst knexInstance = knex(config);\n\ntry {\n  const users = await knex<User>('users').select('id', 'age');\n} catch (err) {\n  // error handling\n}\n```\n\n## Usage as ESM module\n\nIf you are launching your Node application with `--experimental-modules`, `knex.mjs` should be picked up automatically and named ESM import should work out-of-the-box.\nOtherwise, if you want to use named imports, you'll have to import knex like this:\n\n```js\nimport { knex } from 'knex/knex.mjs';\n```\n\nYou can also just do the default import:\n\n```js\nimport knex from 'knex';\n```\n\nIf you are not using TypeScript and would like the IntelliSense of your IDE to work correctly, it is recommended to set the type explicitly:\n\n```js\n/**\n * @type {Knex}\n */\nconst database = knex({\n  client: 'mysql',\n  connection: {\n    host: '127.0.0.1',\n    user: 'your_database_user',\n    password: 'your_database_password',\n    database: 'myapp_test',\n
