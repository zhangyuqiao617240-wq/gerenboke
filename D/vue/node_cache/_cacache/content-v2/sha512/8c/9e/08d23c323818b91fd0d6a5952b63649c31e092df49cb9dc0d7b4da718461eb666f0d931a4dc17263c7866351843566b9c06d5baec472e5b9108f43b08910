Mainly developed for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) but also\nruns on all other [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) environments like [Deno](https://deno.com/), [Bun](https://bun.sh/), [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/)\nand web browsers.\n\n![](https://github.com/kysely-org/kysely/blob/master/assets/demo.gif)\n\nKysely makes sure you only refer to tables and columns that are visible to the part of the query\nyou're writing. The result type only has the selected columns with correct types and aliases. As an\nadded bonus you get autocompletion for all that stuff.\n\nAs shown in the gif above, through the pure magic of modern TypeScript, Kysely is even able to parse\nthe alias given to `pet.name` and add the `pet_name` column to the result row type. Kysely is able to infer\ncolumn names, aliases and types from selected subqueries, joined subqueries, `with` statements and pretty\nmuch anything you can think of.\n\nOf course there are cases where things cannot be typed at compile time, and Kysely offers escape\nhatches for these situations. See the [sql template tag](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/interfaces/Sql.html)\nand the [DynamicModule](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/classes/DynamicModule.html#ref) for more info.\n\nAll API documentation is written in the typing files and you can simply hover over the module, class\nor method you're using to see it in your IDE. The same documentation is also hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/).\n\nIf you start using Kysely and can't find something you'd want to use, please open an issue or join our\n[Discord server](https://discord.gg/xyBJ3GwvAm).\n\n# Getting started\n\nPlease visit our documentation site [kysely.dev](https://kysely.dev) to get started. We also have a comprehensive\nAPI documentation hosted [here](https://kysely-org.github.io/kysely-apidoc/), but you can access the same\ndocumentation in your IDE by hovering over a class/method/property/whatever.\n\n# Core team\n\n## Project leads\n\nResponsible for project direction, API design, maintenance, code reviews, community support, documentation, and working on some of
