It's a spin-off project from [Dabblet](https://dabblet.com/).\n\nYou can learn more on [prismjs.com](https://prismjs.com/).\n\n[Why another syntax highlighter?](https://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/#more-1841)\n\n[More themes for Prism!](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes)\n\n## Contribute to Prism!\n\n### **Important Notice**\n\nWe are currently working on [Prism v2](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions/3531) and will only accept security-relevant PRs for the time being.\n\nOnce work on Prism v2 is sufficiently advanced, we will accept PRs again. This will be announced on our [Discussion](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions) page and mentioned in the [roadmap discussion](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/discussions/3531).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Prism v1 contributing notes</summary>\n\nPrism depends on community contributions to expand and cover a wider array of use cases. If you like it, consider giving back by sending a pull request. Here are a few tips:\n\n- Read the [documentation](https://prismjs.com/extending.html). Prism was designed to be extensible.\n- Do not edit `prism.js`, it’s just the version of Prism used by the Prism website and is built automatically. Limit your changes to the unminified files in the `components/` folder. `prism.js` and all minified files are generated by our build system (see below).\n- Use `npm ci` to install Prism's dependencies. Do not use `npm install` because it will cause non-deterministic builds.\n- The build system uses [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) to minify the files and build `prism.js`. With all of Prism's dependencies installed, you just need to run the command `npm run build`.\n- Please follow the code conventions used in the files already. For example, I use [tabs for indentation and spaces for alignment](http://lea.verou.me/2012/01/why-tabs-are-clearly-superior/). Opening braces are on the same line, closing braces on their own line regardless of construct. There is a space before the opening brace. etc etc.\n- Please try to err towards more smaller PRs rather than a few huge PRs. If a PR includes changes that I want to merge and also changes that I don't, handling it becomes difficult.\n- My time is very limited these days, so it might take a long time to review bigger PRs (small ones are usually merged very quickly), especially those modifying the Prism Core. This doesn't mean your PR is rejected.\n- If you contribute a new language definition, you will be responsible for handling bug reports about that language definition.\n- If you [add a new language definition](https://prismjs.com/extending.html#creating-a-new-language-definition) or plugin, you need to add it to `components.json` as well and rebuild Prism by running `npm run build`, so that it becomes available to the download build page. For new languages, please also add a few [tests](https://prismjs.com/test-suite.html) and an example in the `examples/` folder.\n- Go to [prism-themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes) if you want to add a new theme.\n\nThank you so much for contributing!!\n\n### Software requirements\n\nPrism will run on [almost any browser](https://prismjs.com/#features-full) and Node.js version but you need the following software to contribute:\n\n- Node.js >= 10.x\n- npm >= 6.x\n\n</details>\n\n## Translations\n\n* [简体中文](https://www.awesomes.cn/repo/PrismJS/prism) (if unavailable, see [here](https://deepmind.t-salon.cc/article/113))\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T13:02:23.781Z","modified":"2025-12-06T17:39:27.896Z","1.25.0":"2021-09-16T16:17:34.789Z","1.24.1":"2021-07-03T11:49:04.160Z","1.24.0":"2021-06-27T20:03:59.262Z","1.23.0":"2020-12-31T18:46:58.434Z","1.22.0":"2020-10-10T18:25:21.306Z","1.21.0":"2020-08-06T23:17:32.380Z","1.20.0":"2020-04-04T01:04:54.672Z","1.19.0":"2020-01-13T13:39:48.212Z","1.18.0":"2020-01-04T21:36:41.973Z","1.17.1":"2019-07-22T02:08:37.262Z","1.17.0":"2019-07-22T02:05:58.666Z","1.16.0":"2019-03-25T11:37:08.871Z","1.15.0":"2018-06-17T01:52:23.178Z","1.14.0":"2018-04-11T07:07:37.342Z","1.13.0":"2018-03-21T07:33:19.843Z","1.12.2":"2018-03-08T22:48:14.877Z","1.12.0":"2018-03-07T20:47:42.924Z","1.11.0":"2018-02-05T08:03:40.974Z","1.10.0":"2018-01-17T22:58:11.306Z","1.9.0":"2017-12-05T23:52:53.059Z","1.8.4":"2017-11-05T16:39:11.337Z","1.8.3":"2017-10-19T19:59:49.084Z","1.8.1":"2017-09-16T11:35:42.623Z","1.8.0":"2017-09-16T11:26:30.833Z","1.7.0":"2017-09-09T13:17:53.558Z","1.6.0":"2016-12-05T15:15:07.039Z","1.5.1":"2016-06-07T01:45:09.291Z","1.5.0":"2016-05-16T19:27:36.144Z","1.4.1":"2016-02-05T03:02:10.903Z","1.3.0":"2015-10-27T02:35:27.738Z","1.2.0":"2015-10-07T17:35:20.776Z","1.1.0":"2015-10-06T00:03:04.995Z","0.0.1":"2015-05-13T00:37:38.541Z","1.26.0":"2022-01-06T17:49:41.494Z","1.27.0":"2022-02-17T21:38:58.307Z","1.28.0":"2022-04-17T12:21:38.540Z","1.29.0":"2022-08-23T10:42:14.395Z","1.30.0":"2025-03-10T17:56:20.460Z"},"versions":{"1.25.0":{"name":"prismjs","version":"1.25.0","description":"Lightweight, robust, elegant syntax highlighting.
