If you need to create a key vault, you can do so in the Azure Portal by following the steps in [this document][azure_keyvault_portal]. Alternatively, you can use the Azure CLI by following the steps in [this document][azure_keyvault_cli].\n\n### Install the package\n\nInstall the Azure Key Vault Secret client library using npm:\n\n`npm install @azure/keyvault-secrets`\n\n### Install the identity library\n\nKey Vault clients authenticate using the Azure Identity Library. Install it as well using npm\n\n`npm install @azure/identity`\n\n### Configure TypeScript\n\nTypeScript users need to have Node type definitions installed:\n\n```bash\nnpm install @types/node\n```\n\nYou also need to enable `compilerOptions.allowSyntheticDefaultImports` in your tsconfig.json. Note that if you have enabled `compilerOptions.esModuleInterop`, `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` is enabled by default. See [TypeScript's compiler options handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for more information.\n\n## Key concepts\n\n- The **Secret client** is the primary interface to interact with the API methods\n  related to secrets in the Azure Key Vault API from a JavaScript application.\n  Once initialized, it provides a basic set of methods that can be used to\n  create, read, update and delete secrets.\n- A **Secret version** is a version of a secret in the Key Vault.\n  Each time a user assigns a value to a unique secret name, a new **version**\n  of that secret is created. Retrieving a secret by a name will always return\n  the latest value assigned, unless a specific version is provided to the\n  query.\n- **Soft delete** allows Key Vaults to support deletion and purging as two\n  separate steps, so deleted secrets are not immediately lost. This only happens if the Key Vault\n  has [soft-delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete)\n  enabled.\n- A **Secret backup** can be generated from any created secret. These backups come as\n  binary data, and can only be used to regenerate a previously deleted secret.\n\n## Authenticating with Azure Active Directory\n\nThe Key Vault service relies on Azure Active Directory to authenticate requests to its APIs. The [`@azure/identity`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/identity) package provides a variety of credential types that your application can use to do this. The [README for `@azure/identity`](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/identity/identity/README.md) provides more details and samples to get you started.\n\nIn order to interact with the Azure Key Vault service, you will need to create an instance of the `SecretClient` class, a **vault url** and a credential object. The examples shown in this document use a credential object named [`DefaultAzureCredential`][default_azure_credential], which is appropriate for most scenarios, including local development and production environments. Additionally, we recommend using a [managed identity][managed_identity] for authentication in production environments.\n\nYou can find more information on different ways of authenticating and their corresponding credential types in the [Azure Identity documentation][azure_identity].\n\nHere's a quick example. First, import `DefaultAzureCredential` and `SecretClient`. Once these are imported, we can next connect to the Key Vault service:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleCreateClient\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\n// Build the URL to reach your key vault\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\n// Lastly, create our keys client and connect to the service\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n```\n\n## Specifying the Azure Key Vault service API version\n\nBy default, this package uses the latest Azure Key Vault service version which is `7.1`. The only other version that is supported is `7.0`. You can change the service version being used by setting the option `serviceVersion` in the client constructor as shown below:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleCreateClientWithVersion\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\n// Build the URL to reach your key vault\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\n// Change the Azure Key Vault service API version being used via the `serviceVersion` option\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential, {\n  serviceVersion: \"7.0\", // Or 7.1\n});\n```\n\n## Examples\n\nThe following sections provide code snippets that cover some of the common\ntasks using Azure Key Vault Secrets. The scenarios that are covered here consist of:\n\n- [Creating and setting a secret](#creating-and-setting-a-secret).\n- [Getting a secret](#getting-a-secret).\n- [Creating and updating secrets with attributes](#creating-and-updating-secrets-with-attributes).\n- [Deleting a secret](#deleting-a-secret).\n- [Iterating lists of secrets](#iterating-lists-of-secrets).\n\n### Creating and setting a secret\n\n`setSecret` assigns a provided value to the specified secret name. If a secret\nwith the same name already exists, then a new version of the secret is created.\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleCreateSecret\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst result = await client.setSecret(secretName, \"MySecretValue\");\nconsole.log(\"result: \", result);\n```\n\n### Getting a secret\n\nThe simplest way to read secrets back from the vault is to get a secret by\nname. This will retrieve the most recent version of the secret. You can\noptionally get a different version of the key if you specify it as part of the\noptional parameters.\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleGetSecret\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst latestSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName);\nconsole.log(`Latest version of the secret ${secretName}: `, latestSecret);\n\nconst specificSecret = await client.getSecret(secretName, {\n  version: latestSecret.properties.version!,\n});\nconsole.log(\n  `The secret ${secretName} at the version ${latestSecret.properties.version!}: `,\n  specificSecret,\n);\n```\n\n### Creating and updating secrets with attributes\n\nA secret can have more information than its name and its value. They can also include\nthe following attributes:\n\n- `tags`: Any set of key-values that can be used to search and filter secrets.\n- `contentType`: Any string that can be used to help the receiver of the secret understand how to use the secret value.\n- `enabled`: A boolean value that determines whether the secret value can be read or not.\n- `notBefore`: A given date after which the secret value can be retrieved.\n- `expiresOn`: A given date after which the secret value cannot be retrieved.\n\nAn object with these attributes can be sent as the third parameter of\n`setSecret`, right after the secret's name and value, as follows:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleCreateSecretWithAttributes\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst result = await client.setSecret(secretName, \"MySecretValue\", {\n  enabled: false,\n});\n```\n\nThis will create a new version of the same secret, which will have the latest\nprovided attributes.\n\nAttributes can also be updated to an existing secret version with\n`updateSecretProperties`, as follows:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleUpdateSecretAttributes\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst result = await client.getSecret(secretName);\nawait client.updateSecretProperties(secretName, result.properties.version, { enabled: false });\n```\n\n### Deleting a secret\n\nThe `beginDeleteSecret` method starts the deletion of a Secret.\nThis process will happen in the background as soon as the necessary resources\nare available.\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleDeleteSecret\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nawait client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);\n```\n\nIf [soft-delete](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-ovw-soft-delete)\nis enabled for the Key Vault, this operation will only label the secret as a\n_deleted_ secret. A deleted secret can't be updated. They can only be either\nread, recovered or purged.\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleDeleteSecretSoftDelete\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst poller = await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);\n\n// You can use the deleted secret immediately:\nconst deletedSecret = poller.getResult();\n\n// The secret is being deleted. Only wait for it if you want to restore it or purge it.\nawait poller.pollUntilDone();\n\n// You can also get the deleted secret this way:\nawait client.getDeletedSecret(secretName);\n\n// Deleted secrets can also be recovered or purged.\n\n// recoverDeletedSecret returns a poller, just like beginDeleteSecret.\nconst recoverPoller = await client.beginRecoverDeletedSecret(secretName);\nawait recoverPoller.pollUntilDone();\n\n// And then, to purge the deleted secret:\nawait client.purgeDeletedSecret(secretName);\n```\n\nSince Secrets take some time to get fully deleted, `beginDeleteSecret`\nreturns a Poller object that keeps track of the underlying Long Running\nOperation according to our guidelines:\nhttps://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/typescript_design.html#ts-lro\n\nThe received poller will allow you to get the deleted secret by calling to `poller.getResult()`.\nYou can also wait until the deletion finishes, either by running individual service\ncalls until the secret is deleted, or by waiting until the process is done:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleDeleteSecretWait\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst poller = await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);\n\n// You can use the deleted secret immediately:\nlet deletedSecret = poller.getResult();\n\n// Or you can wait until the secret finishes being deleted:\ndeletedSecret = await poller.pollUntilDone();\nconsole.log(deletedSecret);\n```\n\nAnother way to wait until the secret is fully deleted is to do individual calls, as follows:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleDeleteSecretWaitIndividually\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nconst delay = (ms) => new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, ms));\n\nconst poller = await client.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);\nwhile (!poller.isDone()) {\n  await poller.poll();\n  await delay(5000);\n}\n\nconsole.log(`The secret ${secretName} is fully deleted`);\n```\n\n### Iterating lists of secrets\n\nUsing the SecretClient, you can retrieve and iterate through all of the\nsecrets in a Key Vault, as well as through all of the deleted secrets and the\nversions of a specific secret. The following API methods are available:\n\n- `listPropertiesOfSecrets` will list all of your non-deleted secrets by their names, only\n  at their latest versions.\n- `listDeletedSecrets` will list all of your deleted secrets by their names,\n  only at their latest versions.\n- `listPropertiesOfSecretVersions` will list all the versions of a secret based on a secret\n  name.\n\nWhich can be used as follows:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleListSecrets\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nfor await (const secretProperties of client.listPropertiesOfSecrets()) {\n  console.log(\"Secret properties: \", secretProperties);\n}\n\nfor await (const deletedSecret of client.listDeletedSecrets()) {\n  console.log(\"Deleted secret: \", deletedSecret);\n}\n\nfor await (const versionProperties of client.listPropertiesOfSecretVersions(secretName)) {\n  console.log(\"Version properties: \", versionProperties);\n}\n```\n\nAll of these methods will return **all of the available results** at once. To\nretrieve them by pages, add `.byPage()` right after invoking the API method you\nwant to use, as follows:\n\n```ts snippet:ReadmeSampleListSecretsByPage\nimport { DefaultAzureCredential } from \"@azure/identity\";\nimport { SecretClient } from \"@azure/keyvault-secrets\";\n\nconst credential = new DefaultAzureCredential();\n\nconst vaultName = \"<YOUR KEYVAULT NAME>\";\nconst url = `https://${vaultName}.vault.azure.net`;\n\nconst client = new SecretClient(url, credential);\n\nconst secretName = \"MySecretName\";\n\nfor await (const page of client.listPropertiesOfSecrets().byPage()) {\n  for (const secretProperties of page) {\n    console.log(\"Secret properties: \", secretProperties);\n  }\n}\nfor await (const page of client.listDeletedSecrets().byPage()) {\n  for (const deletedSecret of page) {\n    console.log(\"Deleted secret: \", deletedSecret);\n  }\n}\nfor await (const page of client.listPropertiesOfSecretVersions(secretName).byPage()) {\n  for (const versionProperties of page) {\n    console.log(\"Version properties: \", versionProperties);\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nSee our [troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-js/blob/main/sdk/keyvault/keyvault-secrets/TROUBLESHOOTING.md) for details on how to diagnose various failure scenarios.\n\nEnabling logging may help uncover useful information about failures. In order to see a log of HTTP requests and responses, set the `AZURE_LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `info`. Alternatively, logging can be enabled at runtime by calling `setLogLevel` in the `@azure/logger`:\n\n```ts snippet:SetLogLevel\nimport { setLogLevel } from \"@azure/logger\";\n\nsetLogLevel(\"info\");\n```\n\n## Next steps\n\nYou can find more code samples through the following links:\n\n- [Key Vault Secrets Samples
