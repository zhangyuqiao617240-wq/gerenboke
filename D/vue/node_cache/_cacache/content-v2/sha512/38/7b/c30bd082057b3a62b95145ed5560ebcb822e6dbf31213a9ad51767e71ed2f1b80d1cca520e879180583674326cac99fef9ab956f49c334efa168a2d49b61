@capacitor/preferences\n\nThe Preferences API provides a simple key/value persistent store for lightweight data.\n\nMobile OSs may periodically clear data set in `window.localStorage`, so this\nAPI should be used instead. This API will fall back to using `localStorage`\nwhen running as a Progressive Web App.\n\nThis plugin will use\n[`UserDefaults`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/userdefaults)\non iOS and\n[`SharedPreferences`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/SharedPreferences)\non Android. Stored data is cleared if the app is uninstalled.\n\n**Note**: This API is _not_ meant to be used as a local database. If your app\nstores a lot of data, has high read/write load, or requires complex querying,\nwe recommend taking a look at a SQLite-based solution. One such solution is [Ionic Secure Storage](https://ionic.io/docs/secure-storage), a SQLite-based engine with full encryption support. The [Capacitor Community](https://github.com/capacitor-community/) has also built a number of other storage engines.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install @capacitor/preferences\nnpx cap sync\n```\n\n## Apple Privacy Manifest Requirements\n\nApple mandates that app developers now specify approved reasons for API usage to enhance user privacy. By May 1st, 2024, it's required to include these reasons when submitting apps to the App Store Connect.\n\nWhen using this specific plugin in your app, you must create a `PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy` file in `/ios/App` or use the VS Code Extension to generate it, specifying the usage reasons.\n\nFor detailed steps on how to do this, please see the [Capacitor Docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios/privacy-manifest).\n\n**For this plugin, the required dictionary key is [NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api#4278401) and the recommended reason is [CA92.1](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/privacy_manifest_files/describing_use_of_required_reason_api#4278401).**\n\n### Example PrivacyInfo.xcprivacy\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\n  <dict>\n    <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypes</key>\n    <array>\n      <!-- Add this dict entry to the array if the PrivacyInfo file already exists -->\n      <dict>\n        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPIType</key>\n        <string>NSPrivacyAccessedAPICategoryUserDefaults</string>\n        <key>NSPrivacyAccessedAPITypeReasons</key>\n        <array>\n          <string>CA92.1</string>\n        </array>\n      </dict>\n    </array>\n  </dict>\n</plist>\n```\n\n## Example Plugin Usage\n\n```typescript\nimport { Preferences } from '@capacitor/preferences';\n\nconst setName = async () => {\n  await Preferences.set({\n    key: 'name',\n    value: 'Max',\n  });\n};\n\nconst checkName = async () => {\n  const { value } = await Preferences.get({ key: 'name' });\n\n  console.log(`Hello ${value}!`);\n};\n\nconst removeName = async () => {\n  await Preferences.remove({ key: 'name' });\n};\n```\n\n## Working with JSON\n\nThe Preferences API only supports string values. You can, however, use JSON if you `JSON.stringify` the object before calling `set()`, then `JSON.parse` the value returned from `get()`.\n\nThis method can also be used to store non-string values, such as numbers and booleans.\n\n## API\n\n<docgen-index>\n\n* [`configure(...)`](#configure)\n* [`get(...)`](#get)\n* [`set(...)`](#set)\n* [`remove(...)`](#remove)\n* [`clear()`](#clear)\n* [`keys()`](#keys)\n* [`migrate()`](#migrate)\n* [`removeOld()`](#removeold)\n* [Interfaces](#interfaces)\n\n</docgen-index>\n\n<docgen-api>\n<!--Update the source file JSDoc comments and rerun docgen to update the docs below-->\n\n### configure(...)\n\n```typescript\nconfigure(options: ConfigureOptions) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nConfigure the preferences plugin at runtime.\n\nOptions that are `undefined` will not be used.\n\n| Param         | Type                                                          |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#configureoptions\">ConfigureOptions</a></code> |\n\n**Since:** 1.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n### get(...)\n\n```typescript\nget(options: GetOptions) => Promise<GetResult>\n```\n\nGet the value from preferences of a given key.\n\n| Param         | Type                                              |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#getoptions\">GetOptions</a></code> |\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#getresult\">GetResult</a>&gt;</code>\n\n**Since:** 1.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n### set(...)\n\n```typescript\nset(options: SetOptions) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nSet the value in preferences for a given key.\n\n| Param         | Type                                              |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#setoptions\">SetOptions</a></code> |\n\n**Since:** 1.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n### remove(...)\n\n```typescript\nremove(options: RemoveOptions) => Promise<void>\n```\n\nRemove the value from preferences for a given key, if any.\n\n| Param         | Type                                                    |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **`options`** | <code><a href=\"#removeoptions\">RemoveOptions</a></code> |\n\n**Since:** 1.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n### clear()\n\n```typescript\nclear() => Promise<void>\n```\n\nClear keys and values from preferences.\n\n**Since:** 1.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n### keys()\n\n```typescript\nkeys() => Promise<KeysResult>\n```\n\nReturn the list of known keys in preferences.\n\n**Returns:** <code>Promise&lt;<a href=\"#keysresult\">KeysResult</a>&gt;</code>\n\n**Since:** 1.0.0\n\n--------------------\n\n\n### migrate()\n\n```typescript\nmigrate() => Promise<MigrateResult>\n```\n\nMigrate data from the Capacitor 2 Storage plugin.\n\nThis action is non-destructive.
